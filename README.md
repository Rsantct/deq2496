# deq2496

A tool to manage the digital processor Behringer ultracurve PRO DEQ2496 EQ/RTA.

Currently, I use the Ultracurve just as an RTA and level meter to monitor my PC based audio system.

This is just an experimental tool, with very basic features ;-)

## Software

**`Python3`** modules:

      rtmidi
      mido
      yaml
      numpy
      matplotlib

## Hardware

To communicate with the device, you need a In/Out MIDI interface.
